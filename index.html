        <p>I was born and raised in Seattle, Washington and moved to utah to go to the University of Utah for chemistry.<br>
            I ended up getting a degree in both biology and chemistry and worked as a chemist for a DNA lab in utah for
            the last three years.<br>
            I decided to undergo a carrer change to development because I loved working with the programs at my previous
            workplaces.
